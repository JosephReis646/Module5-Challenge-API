## Description

## User Story
```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```
## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
## What we did
```
Updated the HTML so that it would have the remaining working hours (added hours 12pm-5pm).
Display current date.
Planner is aware of current time and each hour is color coded in past, present, and future. 
Able to add events into planner and it is saved upon a refresh.
